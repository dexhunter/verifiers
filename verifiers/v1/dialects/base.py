"""The `Dialect` abstraction: one native wire format, translated to vf for the trace.

A `Dialect[ReqT, RespT]` is the per-format translator the interception server uses to build the
trace from the program's native request + the provider's native response. The server serves
every registered dialect's `routes` (see `dialects.DIALECTS`), so a request's format is resolved
from the endpoint the program's SDK posts to — the harness declares nothing.

The eval client preserves a request's native JSON fields except for eval-owned overrides, while a
dialect-owned `StreamParser` incrementally assembles a response copy for the trace; the renderer is chat-only.
A dialect owns both translation directions: parsing for the trace, native message replacement for
`@intercept`, eval-owned request overrides, and chat-only user-simulator extension.
